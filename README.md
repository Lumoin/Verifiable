# Verifable library

Blend of _verifiable_ and _fable_. For the good, bad and ugly stories in life.

<hr>

This repository contains projects that implement .NET libraries for [W3C decentralized identifier specification (DID)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) and related technologies from [Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)](https://identity.foundation/).

In simple terms these libraries implement a specification for documents that have distinquishing identifier, can be signed, linked, timestamped, managed and combined into representations without the necessity of a central, governing party but can also function well with such parties.

Since this technology and its likely applications rely on cryptography, these libraries include basic implementation for management of secrets such as the created documents and their material. Technologies include _trusted platform modules_ (TPM), _hardware security modules_ (HSM) and other potential technology such secure enclaves.
